[h3]Raise Ally[/h3]
[code]#showtooltip Raise Ally
/cast [@mouseover,help,dead][]Raise Ally[/code]
This will cast your [spell=61999] on the player you have your cursor over. It works on both the actual corpse as well as unit frames. If you aren't currently over an eligible target, it will instead cast it on your target.

[h3]Mind Freeze[/h3]
[code]#showtooltip Mind Freeze
/cast [@focus,harm,nodead][] Mind Freeze[/code]
This will attempt to interrupt your focus target if they're eligible to interrupt. If you don't have a focus target (or if your focus is, for example, a friendly player,) it will instead interrupt your current target.

[h3]Gorefiend's Grasp[/h3]
[code]#showtooltip Gorefiend's Grasp
/cast [@focus] Gorefiend's Grasp[/code]
This will always center your [spell=108199] on your focus target. This can be useful if grouping adds to a designated player, for example.
[pad]
[code]#showtooltip Gorefiend's Grasp
/cast [@mouseover,exists,nodead][@player] Gorefiend's Grasp[/code]
This will center your [spell=108199] on the player, NPC, or unit frame you currently have your cursor over, if they are eligible.  If you are not moused over an eligible target, it will center on yourself.

[h3]Death and Decay[/h3]
[code]#showtooltip Death and Decay
/cast [mod:ctrl, @mouseover] Death and Decay; [@player] Death and Decay[/code]
This will let you bypass the ground targeting reticle and cast [spell=43265] at your cursor by holding down the Control key while casting, and directly under your feet otherwise.

[h3]Pull Timers[/h3]
[code]/pull 10[/code]
If you have [url=https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/deadly-boss-mods]Deadly Boss Mods[/url] or [url=https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/big-wigs]BigWigs[/url] installed, this will issue a pull timer to the raid for the number of seconds specified (10 seconds in the example above.) You will need to have raid assist or lead in order to issue this command.
[pad]
[code]/pull 0[/code]
This will cancel an existing pull timer.
