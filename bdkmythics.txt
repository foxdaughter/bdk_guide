[h2]Blood Death Knight Strengths[/h2]
Blood Death Knights are, overall, a strong choice for Mythic+.  Blood has a number of utility options that work very well in Mythic+, and Blood's high self-sustain can make it a very attractive choice, particularly in higher-tier keys or with affixes that require significant party healing. More than most tanks, Blood Death Knights have a number of tools to shape pulls and position enemies.

[h2]Blood Death Knight Weaknesses[/h2]
As with raiding, Blood struggles with massive attacks that advantage proactive defenses and "proper" active mitigation abilities. Blood continues to have a lower degree of mobility compared to other tanks as well; this can make kiting more difficult for Blood than other tanks.

[h2]Mythic+ Talents[/h2]
Your default choices will prioritize your ability to control and survive large groups of enemies.  [spell=221536] gets significant benefit in Mythic+ trash, though on lower keys you will typically keep [spell=206931] for the additional damage.  [spell=273952] is extremely useful for setting up to kite enemies, as well as providing a snap snare.  [spell=194844] is the star of the show in Mythic+, dealing massive damage and keeping you nearly immortal for 10 seconds every minute.

[h2]Mythic+ Utility[/h2]
[ul]
[li][spell=108199] is an incredibly powerful tool, exclusive to Blood Death Knights, that can shape pulls by grouping enemies into a single point to maximize the effect of both cleave damage and crowd control abilities. [/li]
[li][spell=49576], beyond the obvious value of repositioning casters or enemies that you've lost aggro on, can be used to disrupt channeled spell casts - when an enemy actually finishes the windup cast and begins to channel, any forced movement will interrupt the channel and place it on cooldown. Note that enemies that are immune to movement effects, to include enemies that are currently rooted, will not be interrupted by Death Grip.[/li]
[li][spell=47528], our interrupt, operates like other melee interrupts except with the advantage of a 15-yard range.  This makes us particularly effective for catching interrupts during repositioning, bringing casters into cleave range, and moving casters out of void zones.[/li]
[li]When you have [spell=273952] selected, [spell=43265] becomes a powerful AoE snare.  This is especially useful for kiting, but many other situations in Mythic+ can find advantage from this as well.[/li]
[li][spell=221562] is a single-target, 4-second stun. It can be used to lock down dangerous uninterruptible casts or prevent enemies from fleeing. Note that enemies that are immune to stuns will not be interrupted by Asphyxiate.[/li]
[li][spell=61999] is our combat resurrection spell.  It operates on a shared cooldown with other combat resurrections, and costs 30 Runic Power.  The cost makes this a hard pill to swallow as a Blood DK - if someone is already dead, chances are you're putting yourself in danger to use the Runic Power for a resurrection.  Regardless, you should be aware and stand ready to use this ability - the instant nature of Raise Ally can make the difference between victory and a team wipe, as long as you don't hesitate.[/li]
[li][spell=111673] allows you to place an undead enemy under your control as a pet.  This can make the pet's abilities available to you, which can be very powerful.  Even without special abilities, this is a pure damage gain for minimal effort in any dungeon with controllable undead enemies.[/li]

[h2]Affix Tips[/h2]

[h3]Tier 2+ Affixes[/h3]
[table class="grid"][tr][td]Affix[/td][td]Recommendations[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][affix=9][/td][td]On higher-tier keys, consider dropping [spell=194844] for [spell=114556].  Boss abilities can easily one-shot you and force a team wipe with this affix.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][affix=10][/td][td]On higher-tier keys you will definitely want to pick up [spell=221536]; the additional throughput will make a big difference in your survival.  Know when to kite and be ready to use [spell=43265] to give yourself breathing room.[/td][/tr]
[/table]
[h3]Tier 4+ Affixes[/h3]
[table class="grid"][tr][td]Affix[/td][td]Recommendations[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][affix=7][/td][td]When facing enemies that flee at low health, this affix can rapidly become a nightmare.  Use [spell=49576], [spell=108199], and [spell=221562] intelligently to keep dying mobs from buffing other packs.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][affix=11][/td][td]Don't fire off a [spell=194844] when enemies are already lower on health with this affix; you need to be able to control when enemies die.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][affix=6][/td][td]Keep a defensive in your pocket for when too many enemies end up raging at the same time.  For particularly heavy-hiting enemies, you may be able to use [spell=221562] to give yourself time to finish them off.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][affix=8][/td][td]DO NOT take [spell=273952] on Sanguine weeks unless you absolutely require it for some specific pull.  The snare is strong enough that you can easily reset enemies to full health accidentally. Consider [spell=206970] instead to give you additional opportunities to pull groups out of pools.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][affix=5][/td][td][spell=221536] is a good option for these weeks, as you'll get maximum value out of it on most pulls.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][affix=15][/td][td]Pay close attention to this buff and don't waste your utility abilities while it's active - if you use a [spell=49576], [spell=221562], or other abilities on immune enemies your spell will still go on cooldown.[/td][/tr]
[/table]
[h3]Tier 7+ Affixes[/h3]
[table class="grid"][tr][td]Affix[/td][td]Recommendations[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][affix=13][/td][td]Generally, ignore these unless your DPS specifically needs help with them - threat generated on orbs that will die in 3 seconds is wasted threat.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][affix=12][/td][td]Pay attention to your group and especially your healer on these weeks.  Don't pull new groups if your healer is still clearing the debuff from the rest of the party.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][affix=4][/td][td]Watch your stacks and use [spell=43265] to kite away and force a reset of your stacks. [spell=48707] can help get you a few more seconds of space while resetting, but it won't last long enough to force a reset by itself.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][affix=14][/td][td]If using [spell=206931], keep in mind that Quaking will interrupt it and shadow-lock you. Other than that, the most important thing is to plant yourself as you pick up new packs - melee will base their quaking positioning off where you are standing.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][affix=2][/td][td]Try to start each pack with 2x [spell=50842] into [spell=43265] and 1-2 [spell=206930] - preserve the relevant cooldowns towards the end of each pack to make sure they're available for the next.  Nothing you do requires maintenence of a debuff on enemies, so you should be cycling through targets throughout each pack to generate enough threat on every target.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][affix=3][/td][td]This will only every affect you if enemies are being kept engaged but out of melee range - crowd controlled enemies, for example.  Because of this, it is easy to become complacent and fail to recognize when this affix is spawning in melee range.[/td][/tr]
[/table]
[h3]Tier 10+ Seasonal Affix - [affix=16][/h3]
You have several tools to keep Spawns from reaching a host.  The most important role you will have is making sure the infested enemies don't die in the wrong place - whatever your group's strategy is, be sure you're positioning enemies to allow your dps to kill the Spawns before they reach a new host.

[h2]Best Dungeons to Farm for Blood Death Knights[/h2]
[ul]
[li][zone=9028] has several very solid choices, including [item=155866], [item=158712], [item=159458], and [item=158313].[/li]
[li][zone=9164] has our best weapon, [item=159634], as well as [item=155890] and [item=158360].[/li]
[li][zone=9526] has [item=159459]. [item=159423] is a decent option for shoulders, and this dungeon also has [item=159644], which is very strong for damage output.  Be sure to run this with Fury Warriors, so you can sup on their tears when it drops for you and you keep it. Or, give it to them, if you're into teamwork or something.[/li]
