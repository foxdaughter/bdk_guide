[h2]What makes Blood Special[/h2]
[guide-content=6433]
[replace="$spec" with="Blood"]
[replace="$class" with="Death Knight"]
[/guide-content]

[ul][li][b]Fantasy:[/b] Blood Death Knights wield the powers of the San'layn, using their abilities to control their blood and harness the life force of their enemies to sustain themselves. [/li]
[li][b]Resources:[/b] Blood DKs use Runes and Runic Power as a resource. Using abilities such as [spell=206930] to generate Runic Power, which is spent on Blood's main mitigation ability, [spell=49998].[/li]
[li][b]Damage Reduction[/b] The Blood Death Knight signature spells are [spell=49998] and [spell=195182], which applies [spell=195181]. Using these spells and [spell=77513] allows them to mitigate damage and heal back the damage they have taken, making them more self-sufficient tanks.[/li]
[li][b]Defensive Abilities:[/b] Blood Death Knights have several defensive cooldowns with tailored uses. [spell=55233] is your main defensive cooldown. This increases your health as well as your healing received from all sources. You also have a unique defensive in [spell=49028], which increases your parry chance and summons a rune weapon that duplicates your spells. [spell=48792] is your strongest defensive cooldown overall, and is often your last line of defense. [spell=48707] is a strong cooldown against magical damage, and more significantly prevents the application of debuffs applied while it is active.[/li]
[li][b]Unique Mount:[/b] DKs gain 3 unique mounts to their class. [spell=48778], [item=40775], and [item=142231].[/li]

[major-heading]What Has Changed from Legion to Battle for Azeroth?[/major-heading]
[guide-content=6403][/guide-content]
[pad]

In this section, we will limit ourselves to changes that make significant changes to how an ability is used; as nearly every ability received some sort of numerical tuning, we will not cover those adjustments here.

[ul][li]The snare effect of [spell=206930] was nerfed to a 20% speed reduction.[/li]
[li]The cooldown of [spell=49028] was reduced to 2 minutes, from 3 minutes previously.[/li]
[li]The radius of [spell=108199] was reduced significantly, from 20 yards to 15 yards.  This is approximately a 40% reduction in the area of effect.[/li]
[li]Icebound Fortitude was buffed, providing a 30% damage reduction, up from 20%.[/li][/ul]

[h3]Talent Changes[/h3]
Several talents were scrapped and replaced with new ones:
[b]Removed[/b]
[ul][li][span class="patch-diff-removed"]REMOVED[/span] [spell=206977][/li]
[li][span class="patch-diff-removed"]REMOVED[/span] [spell=221699][/li]
[li][span class="patch-diff-removed"]REMOVED[/span] [spell=246426][/li]
[li][span class="patch-diff-removed"]REMOVED[/span] [spell=219779][/li]
[li][span class="patch-diff-removed"]REMOVED[/span] [spell=211078][/li]
[li][span class="patch-diff-removed"]REMOVED[/span] [spell=206960][/li][/ul]

[b]Added[/b]
[ul][li][span class="patch-diff-new"]NEW[/span] [spell=274156][/li]
[li][span class="patch-diff-new"]NEW[/span] [spell=273952][/li]
[li][span class="patch-diff-new"]NEW[/span] [spell=273946][/li]
[li][span class="patch-diff-new"]NEW[/span] [spell=210764][/li]
[li][span class="patch-diff-new"]NEW[/span] [spell=273953][/li]
[li][span class="patch-diff-new"]NEW[/span] [spell=212552][/li][/ul]

Other talents were retuned, or otherwise reworked:
[ul][li][spell=206931] technically works exactly the same as before, but with the much larger gap between health pools and damage output, this works out to a de facto nerf to any leech effects.[/li]
[li][spell=194662] had the [resource=6] generation component removed, and now also affects [spell=55078].  This is, ultimately, a massive nerf to the talent.[/li]
[li][spell=206974] was nerfed by 50%, now providing at most 10% maximum Health with a full 10-stack of [spell=195181].[/li]
[li][spell=205727] now provides the effects it would intuitively provide, increasing strength and duration while reducing the cooldown.  The buff to maximum Health was removed.[/li]
[li][spell=194679] provides 10% less damage reduction and lasts 1 second longer. The nerf to effectiveness hurts, but the increase in the duration will actually help significantly on bosses with unpredictable ability usage, like Argus.[/li]
[li][spell=206970] had the snare component removed and reworked into a separate talent, [spell=273952].[/li]
[li][spell=195679] now has a chance to proc on any auto-attack, instead of auto attack crits - this effectively means we can actually rely on getting the full RPPM proc rate of 5 RPPM out of this ability.  Additionally, the increase in auto attack damage affects the bloodworms, making this talent deal respectable damage.[/li]
[li][spell=206940] was significantly nerfed, being placed on a 6-second cooldown, having its duration reduced by 40%, and the healing done reduced by 33%.[/li]
[li][spell=205723] was nerfed to require 10 [resource=6] to reduce the cooldown of [spell=55233] by 1 second, up from 6 [resource=6].[/li]
[li][spell=194844] was buffed to heal 3% of maximum Health per tick, up 50% from the previous value of 2% per tick.[/li][/ul]

[h3]Artifact Traits and Abilities[/h3]
With 8.0.1, all abilities and traits attached to your artifact weapon are disabled.  This has a number of significant impacts on how Blood Death Knights work, even if overall numbers tuning is balanced out:
[ul][li]Losing [spell=192544] means [spell=55233] is just a respectable defensive cooldown, instead of turning you into an unkillable self-regenerating Health pinata for 10 seconds.[/li]
[li]Without [spell=192557], [spell=195182] will generate a flat 3 stacks of [spell=195181], allowing for it to be refreshed at 7 stacks, but increasing the runes spent on [spell=195182] over time, and reducing [resource=6] generation accordingly.[/li]
[li][spell=192548] and [spell=192567] generated a significant amount of leech healing over the course of an encounter, even accounting for overhealing.  Additionally, the loss of [spell=192567] removes the somewhat unreliable (and undesirable) mini-game of trying to time [spell=49998] casts so that two uses could occur between boss melee attacks to benefit from the 25% damage buff.[/li]
[li][spell=193213] provided a comfortable shield at the end of [spell=55233], which works out to a de facto nerf of your most valuable defensive cooldown.[/li]
[li][spell=192570] and [spell=192514] were massive buffs to the effectiveness of [spell=49028], and without them, pressing it will feel much less satisfying and impactful.[/li]
[li][spell=238078] helped define Blood Death Knights as the premier Mythic+ tank; losing it will definitely change the dynamics in dungeon content.[/li]
[li][spell=238114] changed the use of [spell=49998] in a significant manner.  Players will need to adjust their reflexive actions to stop using a [spell=49998] immediately [i]prior[/i] to a large hit.[/li][/ul]

[h3]Item Changes[/h3]
Some of the items associated with Blood Death Knights, particularly legendaries, have been adjusted to account for the changes in patch 8.0.1:
[ul][li][item=132365] is technically unchanged, but the change to the floor value of [spell=49998] means this item will no longer guarantee a runic power refund.[/li]
[li][item=151640] still provides [spell=206974], but with the talent shuffling, this opens up a different pair of talents to choose from.[/li]
[li][item=132453] has had the increased [spell=195181] absorb value changed to a 10% increase to the Armor it now provides.[/li]
[li][item=152626] no longer buffs Netherlight Crucible traits, as they have been disabled. Instead, it provides a 2% increase to damage and healing.[/li][/ul]
