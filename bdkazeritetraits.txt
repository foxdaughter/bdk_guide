[h2]Best Azerite Powers for Blood Death Knight[/h2]
As a Blood Death Knight, you will want to consider both the offensive and defensive benefits of your trait selections.  The offensive traits, particularly those that deal direct damage, can be quite strong for Blood, as they deal the same damage for tanks as they do for other specializations. Some defensive traits are exceptionally powerful and should be pursued; others are simply not strong enough to outweigh the potential for damage from selecting a damage-based trait.  [b]Traits that should be prioritized for Blood DKs are flagged in the tables below with the [icon name=class_deathknight][/icon] icon.[/b]

Some of the powers in Rings 1 and 3 can only be acquired through specific activities; these powers are flagged in the tables below as follows:
[ul]
[li][icon name=side_alliance][/icon][icon name=side_horde][/icon] These powers are faction-specific, and are found on PvP gear and rewards from your War Campaign and the associated faction.[/li]
[li][icon name=trade_engineering size=tiny][/icon] These powers are found on engineer-crafted goggles, and require engineering to use.[/li]
[li][icon name=quest_end][/icon] This power is only available on the starter Azerite Armor you receive at the beginning of the Battle for Azeroth leveling experience.[/li]
[li][icon preset=heroic][/icon] These powers are only available from gear found in the Uldir raid. These powers activate the bonus ability [spell=280573].[/li]

[tr][td][icon preset=heroic][/icon][/td][td][spell=280555][/td][td][icon name=class_deathknight][/icon][/td][td]This will take 90 seconds to ramp up, and provides a moderate amount of Strength.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][/td][td][spell=278484][/td][td][icon name=class_deathknight][/icon][/td][td]The proc rate on this power is fairly low, but it provides more defensive value than most other Tier 1 powers, particularly through the modest buff to Armor. This can be worth keeping one rank of; note that the bonus charge effect is not improved by wearing multiple ranks of this power.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][/td][td][spell=273834][/td][td][icon name=class_deathknight][/icon][/td][td]The life drain on this power is too low to be make it worth pursuing, but it doesn't need to be avoided.[/td][/tr]

[tr][td][/td][td][spell=273682][/td][td][icon name=class_deathknight][/icon][/td][td]You don't effectively have control over this proc, but it's a decent Haste buff.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][/td][td][spell=273790][/td][td][icon name=class_deathknight][/icon][/td][td]This is one of the strongest damage-dealing powers on this Ring.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][/td][td][spell=273829][/td][td][icon name=class_deathknight][/icon][/td][td]The Void Droplets stack with the normal Surging Droplets; this power can provide significant amounts of Strength.  You will need to be aware of how moving to pick up droplets will affect the encounter to use this effectively; sometimes, you will just have to stand still and let droplets despawn.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][icon name=trade_engineering][/icon][/td][td][spell=280174][/td][td][icon name=class_deathknight][/icon][/td][td]If using the Engineering googles, this is your best choice on this tier.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][/td][td][spell=280380][/td][td][icon name=class_deathknight][/icon][/td][td]This power has a higher damage output than any other option for us right now.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][icon name=side_alliance][/icon][icon name=side_horde][/icon][/td][td][spell=280628] / [spell=280598][/td][td][/td][td]This is a Strength proc, with a flavor bonus if someone dies. This can have value particularly during progression, but is only found on PvP rewards.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][icon name=trade_engineering size=tiny][/icon][/td][td][spell=280163][/td][td][/td][td]This power is quite strong, but the lack of defensive benefit makes it a sub-optimal choice for the engineering goggles.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][icon name=side_alliance][/icon][icon name=side_horde][/icon][/td][td][spell=280627] / [spell=280582][/td][td][/td][td]This power is undertuned in PvE encounters and should generally be avoided.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][/td][td][spell=273823][/td][td][/td][td]Critical Strike is our worst secondary; avoid this.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][/td][td][spell=280407][/td][td][/td][td]Haste on an uncontrollable proc is generally less useful than static Haste; however the refresh on kill makes it strong for Mythic+. Unfortunately, it is only found on a handful of items, none of which have particularly good power choices for Rings 2 and 3.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][/td][td][spell=273088][/td][td][/td][td]The amount of damage and healing this power deals is underwhelming.  Avoid it.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][icon name=quest_end][/icon][/td][td][spell=280710][/td][td][/td][td]This power is fine for leveling, and is the only option on your starter item that provides value to other specializations.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][icon name=side_alliance][/icon][icon name=side_horde][/icon][/td][td][spell=280626] / [spell=280830][/td][td][/td][td]A Strength proc is fine, though the maximum health is negligible.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][icon name=side_alliance][/icon][icon name=side_horde][/icon][/td][td][spell=280625] / [spell=280580][/td][td][/td][td]This provides a buff to Attack Power and Spell Power, and has no defensive benefit.  Avoid this.[/td][/tr]

[tr][td][/td][td][spell=272684][/td][td][/td][td]This will provide yield an increase of around 0.1% of your Maximum Health to your [spell=55078] healing.  This power should be avoided.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][/td][td][spell=275924][/td][td][/td][td]This power could have some situational benefit in higher-tier Mythic+, in circumstances where you are taking constant damage even after [spell=55233] expires, and you have enough targets to increase your damage output.  In other any other situation, you'll get more benefit from using an offensive power.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][/td][td][spell=278479][/td][td][/td][td]This power can boost the damage output of [spell=49028] significantly; however, at current levels of Haste it requires you to dump runes in a way that can undermine your overall survivability.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][icon name=side_alliance][/icon][icon name=side_horde][/icon][/td][td][spell=280623] / [spell=280577][/td][td][/td][td]This power is balanced around PvP, and the proc rate is undertuned in PvE.  Avoid this.[/td][/tr]

[tr][td][/td][td][spell=274057][/td][td][/td][td]This only works out to around 0.05% - 0.2% increase to your [spell=49998] healing, and should be avoided.[/td][/tr]

[tr][td][/td][td][spell=281841][/td][td][/td][td]Mastery isn't a stat we actively pursue, but this power is not terrible. Don't actively seek it out, but there's no need to avoid it.[/td][/tr]

[tr][td][/td][td][spell=271540][/td][td][icon name=class_deathknight][/icon][/td][td]This provides around 8% physical damage reduction when it procs; it can be a good choice during progression or on encounters where you continue to actively tank after a high-damage ability that would trigger the effect.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][/td][td][spell=271536][/td][td][icon name=class_deathknight][/icon][/td][td]This should be always active while tanking content of any difficulty, making it an excellent armor buff with the bonus of also increasing damage.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][/td][td][spell=267665][/td][td][icon name=class_deathknight][/icon][/td][td]A meaningful static increase to both Haste and Avoidance, this is an excellent option on this tier.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][/td][td][spell=266937][/td][td][icon name=class_deathknight][/icon][/td][td]This is a strong option for single-target dps, particularly on longer fights.[/td][/tr]

[tr][td][/td][td][spell=267671][/td][td][icon name=class_deathknight][/icon][/td][td]This will provide significant melee avoidance, and is one of the best powers on this tier. Unfortunately, very few pieces of gear exist with this power and good options for Rings 1 and 3.[/td][/tr]

[tr][td][/td][td][spell=266936][/td][td][/td][td]This does not deal enough damage to justify foregoing a defensive power on this row.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][/td][td][spell=267683][/td][td][/td][td]The heal from this is going to have a high uptime for a tank, but is not strong enough to make it something we actively pursue.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][/td][td][spell=264108][/td][td][/td][td]Neither Mastery nor Leech are particularly valuable to us; avoid this power.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][/td][td][spell=279926][/td][td][/td][td]This provides a moderate, fluctuating Strength buff, and is a decent (but not great) option.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][/td][td][spell=263984][/td][td][/td][td]Our secondaries are mostly well-balanced; this isn't a bad option.  Don't seek it out, but it shouldn't be actively avoided.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][/td][td][spell=266180][/td][td][/td][td]This power provides a strong amount of haste, but the decay will be sped up as a tank significantly.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][/td][td][spell=271557][/td][td][/td][td]This power isn't strong enough to justify taking it over other options on this ring, particularly given how it will restrict your movement while benefiting from it.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][/td][td][spell=271546][/td][td][/td][td]Even at its maximum value, the proc is only moderately good, and the situations where you'll be able to reliably benefit from the maximum value are few and far between.  Avoid this.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][/td][td][spell=279899][/td][td][/td][td]Critical Strike is our worst secondary; avoid this.[/td][/tr]

[tr][td][/td][td][spell=270576][/td][td][icon name=class_deathknight][/icon][/td][td]This is the single best power on any tier by a mile.  It should be always active while tanking, and provides incredible value. If at all possible, you should maintain 3 ranks of this power.

[tr][td][/td][td][spell=268595][/td][td][icon name=class_deathknight][/icon][/td][td]This trait is fairly strong on Mythic+ and AoE fights.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][icon name=trade_engineering][/icon][/td][td][spell=280181][/td][td][icon name=class_deathknight][/icon][/td][td]Between the two options on [item=160491], this is the one you'll want to use.[/td][/tr]

[tr][td][/td][td][spell=268594][/td][td][/td][td]The movement speed buff is theoretically nice for questing, but the scaling is so low that you'll barely notice it.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][/td][td][spell=280011][/td][td][/td][td]At lower levels, this is completely negligible; however, at raid gear levels this is a significant boost to the effectiveness of Death's Advance.  It could be worth keeping an item with this power for specific encounters.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][/td][td][spell=263962][/td][td][/td][td]The value of this trait is fairly low compared to other options, and should generally be avoided.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][/td][td][spell=280010][/td][td][/td][td]The additional 1 second on the duration of [spell=48707] could have some situational utility, but otherwise this power should be avoided.[/td][/tr]

For Blood Death Knights, the only power that affects your rotation is [spell=278484]. Due to the chance to proc an additional stack of [spell=195181], if using a rank of this power you should use [spell=195182] at 6 or fewer stacks of [spell=195181] instead of 7.
